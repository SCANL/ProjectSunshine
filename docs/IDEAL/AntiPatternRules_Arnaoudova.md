| Id  | Name                                         | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Python File                                                                                                           |
|-----|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A.1 | Get more than accessor                       | A getter that performs actions other than returning the corresponding attribute.                                                                                                                                                                      | [get_more_than_accessor.py](../../src/rule/linguistic_antipattern/get_more_than_accessor.py)                             |
| A.2 | Is returns more than a Boolean               | The name of a method is a predicate suggesting a true/false value in return. However the return type is not Boolean but rather a more complex type.                                                                                                   | [is_no_return_bool.py](../../src/rule/linguistic_antipattern/is_no_return_bool.py)                                       |
| A.3 | Set method returns                           | A set method having a return type different than void.                                                                                                                                                                                                | [set_returns.py](../../src/rule/linguistic_antipattern/set_returns.py)                                                   |
| A.4 | Expecting but not getting single instance    | The name of a method indicates that a single object is returned but the return type is a collection.                                                                                                                                                  | [expecting_not_getting_single.py](../../src/rule/linguistic_antipattern/expecting_not_getting_single.py)                 |
| B.1 | Not implemented condition                    | The comments of a method suggest a conditional behavior that is not implemented in the code. When the implementation is default this should be documented                                                                                             | [not_implemented_condition.py](../../src/rule/linguistic_antipattern/not_implemented_condition.py)                       |
| B.2 | Validation method does not confirm           | A validation method (e.g., name starting with validate, check, ensure) does not confirm the validation, i.e., the method neither provides a return value informing whether the validation was successful, nor documents how to proceed to understand. | [validate_not_confirm.py](../../src/rule/linguistic_antipattern/validate_not_confirm.py)                                 |
| B.3 | Get method does not return                   | The name suggests that the method returns something (e.g., name starts with get or return) but the return type is void.                                                                                                                               | [get_no_return.py](../../src/rule/linguistic_antipattern/get_no_return.py)                                               |
| B.4 | Not answered question                        | The name of a method is in the form of predicate whereas the return type is not Boolean.                                                                                                                                                              | [not_answered_question.py](../../src/rule/linguistic_antipattern/not_answered_question.py)                               |
| B.5 | Transform method does not return             | The name of a method suggests the transformation of an object but there is no return value and it is not clear from the documentation where the result is stored.                                                                                     | [transform_not_return.py](../../src/rule/linguistic_antipattern/transform_not_return.py)                                 |
| B.6 | Expecting but not getting a collection       | The name of a method suggests that a collection should be returned but a single object or nothing is returned.                                                                                                                                        | [expecting_not_getting_collection.py](../../src/rule/linguistic_antipattern/expecting_not_getting_collection.py)         |
| C.1 | Method name and return type are opposite     | The documentation of a method is in contradiction with its declaration.                                                                                                                                                                               | [method_name_return_opposite.py](../../src/rule/linguistic_antipattern/method_name_return_opposite.py)                   |
| C.2 | Method signature and comment are opposite    | The name of an attribute suggests a single instance, while its type suggests that the attribute stores a collection of objects.                                                                                                                       | [method_signature_comment_opposite.py](../../src/rule/linguistic_antipattern/method_signature_comment_opposite.py)       |
| D.1 | Says one but contains many                   | The name of an attribute suggests a single instance, while its type suggests that the attribute stores a collection of objects.                                                                                                                       | [says_one_contains_many.py](../../src/rule/linguistic_antipattern/says_one_contains_many.py)                             |
| D.2 | Name suggests boolean but type is not        | The name of an attribute suggests that its value is true or false, but its declaring type is not Boolean.                                                                                                                                             | [name_suggest_boolean_type_not.py](../../src/rule/linguistic_antipattern/name_suggest_boolean_type_not.py)               |
| E.1 | Says many but contains one                   | The name of an attribute suggests multiple instances, but its type suggests a single one.                                                                                                                                                             | [says_many_contains_one.py](../../src/rule/linguistic_antipattern/says_many_contains_one.py)                             |
| F.1 | Attribute name and type are opposite         | The name of an attribute is in contradiction with its type as they contain antonyms.                                                                                                                                                                  | [attribute_name_type_opposite.py](../../src/rule/linguistic_antipattern/attribute_name_type_opposite.py)                 |
| F.2 | Attribute signature and comment are opposite | The declaration of an attribute is in contradiction with its documentation.                                                                                                                                                                           | [attribute_signature_comment_opposite.py](../../src/rule/linguistic_antipattern/attribute_signature_comment_opposite.py) |
