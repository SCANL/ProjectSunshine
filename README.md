#### _An Open-Source Identifier Name Appraisal Tool_

### Abstract

Developers must comprehend the code they will maintain, meaning that the code must be legible and reasonably
self-descriptive. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of research and tooling that supports developers in understanding
their naming practices; whether the names they choose make sense, whether they are consistent, and whether they convey
the information required of them. In this paper, we present IDEAL, a tool that will provide feedback to developers about
their identifier naming practices. Among its planned features, it will support linguistic anti-pattern detection, which
is what will be discussed in this paper. IDEAL is designed to, and will, be extended to cover further anti-patterns,
naming structures, and practices in the near future. IDEAL is open-source and publicly available, with a demo video
available at: [https://youtu.be/fVoOYGe50zg](https://youtu.be/fVoOYGe50zg)

### Setup and Use

Details around setting up and using IDEAL are available [here](documentaion/SetupAndUse.md).
